Our objective is to compare different pre trained models to detect fires (specifically forest fires) and conclude which model is most accurate amongst them. 

Data was fetch from various data sites such as Kaggle and research gate.

On the basis of testing data, an accuracy score was derived for each model

This should help the user to select the software which would be best to train a model for this specific use-case (that is, detection of forest fires)
